# Complexity
This is the Eclipse plug-in script used in the
study [Predicting deliverability of volumetric-modulated arc therapy
(VMAT) plans using aperture complexity analysis]
(http://www.jacmp.org/index.php/jacmp/article/view/6241).
Also, see the blog post
[Calculating Aperture Complexity Metrics]
(http://www.carlosjanderson.com/calculating-aperture-complexity-metrics).

Before you can use the script,
you need to edit the ARIA database connection string.
It’s a constant field in src/Complexity.AriaEntity/AriaContext.cs.
The connection string that’s already there
was generated by the EntityFramework for our database,
except for the placeholders *location*, *username*, and *password*.
Replace them with your database information.

The other files you’ll want to edit are imrt.csv and vmat.csv.
These store the historical metrics for IMRT and VMAT plans
that are used for the histogram that’s displayed by the script.
Each line of the file corresponds to a plan’s metrics.
The first column is the body site that was treated,
the second column is the plan’s complexity metric,
and the third and subsequent columns
are each beam’s complexity metric for that plan.
